## What is Wordle?
```
Wordle is an online word game in which the player has to guess a five-letter word in 
six attempts.Each time the player makes a guess, they are told which of their chosen
letters are in the target word and whether they are in the correct place or not.
Green colour indicates that the letter is in the word and in the correct place.
Yellow/Orange colour indicates that the letter is in the word but in the wrong place.
